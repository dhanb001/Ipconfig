# IPConfigure Java Programming Evaluation

### Access Instructions

In order to access the java files I have created, it is **highly** recommended that you use an Eclipse IDE.\
The files in this project were created using Eclipse. Eclipse auto-builds files and projects, meaning build scripts aren't necessary
for compilation and creation in Eclipse.\
\
This README file will explain how to run each of the specific projects and will give any additional info regarding them.
I will also include a developer diary of sorts at the end, so feel free to view that if you wish.\
\
It is assumed from this point forward that Eclipse is being used to run these programs, 
therefore instructions will be directed to work in Eclipse.
## Download instructions
To download these files, click clone or download on the main page of the repository https://github.com/dhanb001/Ipconfig
