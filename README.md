# IPConfigure Java Programming Evaluation

### Access Instructions

In order to access the java files I have created, it is **highly** recommended that you use an Eclipse IDE.\
The files in this project were created using Eclipse. Eclipse auto-builds files and projects, meaning build scripts aren't necessary
for compilation and creation in Eclipse.\
\
This README file will explain how to run each of the specific projects and will give any additional info regarding them.
I will also include a developer diary of sorts at the end, so feel free to view that if you wish.\
\
It is assumed from this point forward that Eclipse is being used to run these programs, 
therefore instructions will be directed to work in Eclipse.
## Download instructions
To download these files, click clone or download on the main page of the repository https://github.com/dhanb001/Ipconfig

The clone URL is: https://github.com/dhanb001/Ipconfig.git

Once you have the clone URL. Open your Eclipse IDE

### Cloning the repository in Eclipse

1. Go to your workbench in Eclipse.
2. Click the Quick Access box in the upper right corner and type in *"Clone a github repository"*

8. Now press **Finish.**

### Accessing the Repository

You've successfully cloned the repository, but you still need to access it in your workspace.
![Where's my repository?](IPConfig/needtoimport.PNG)\
There's a few steps we need to take to accomplish that.


1. Go to the quick access box in the corner, and type in *"Open Projects from File System"
![Quick Access](IPConfig/quickaccess.PNG)


2. Once you've opened the quick access tab, you should see this.
![Open from file system](IPConfig/openfromfilesystem.PNG)


3. Now, navigate to the directory where you stored the repository.

And select the folder named IPConfig.


4. Now just press **finish.**
![Finish it](IPConfig/afterselecting.PNG)


You're done!

Now your screen should look like this:\
![No opened folders](IPConfig/itshouldbethere.PNG)


And if you open the folders, they should look like:
![Opened folders](IPConfig/whattheyshouldlooklike.PNG)


Now we just need to run the projects.
